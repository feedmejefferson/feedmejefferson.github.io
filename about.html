      <h1>About Us</h1>
      <h2>Chef Jefferson</h2>
      <p>I'm Chef Jefferson -- the head chef here at Jefferson Feed Me!</p>
      <p>When I met Karen, I took over the responsibility of feeding her; we even went so far as to put it in my wedding vow -- "... to love and cherish, to feed and nourish..."</p>
      <p>It's usually an easy job -- as long as I have cheese and refried beans on hand. Sometimes though, Karen gets a craving and she just doesn't know what she's hungry for. I generally ask a bunch of questions -- do you want something hot, or cold? Sweet or savory? I always thought it would be easier if there was an app that would help her figure out what she was hungry for though, so that she could just show me.</p>
      <p>And that's where our story began...</p>
      <h2>Our Mission</h2>
      <p>Our mission is very simple -- to keep Karen fed and happy!</p>
      <p>If it turns out that others can benefit from our mission, so be it.</p>
